# Enso Astrology — Brand & Style Guide

## The Name

**Enso** (円相) — the Zen brushstroke circle, drawn in a single breath. It represents enlightenment, the universe, and the void. The enso maps directly onto the natal chart wheel: a circle that captures one perfect moment in time. Your chart is complete as-is — a snapshot of the sky, drawn in a single stroke.

## Brand Concept

The intersection of three threads:

1. **Japanese minimalism** — Ma (間), negative space as a design element. Wabi-sabi, the beauty of imperfection. Sumi-e ink painting, where a single brushstroke carries meaning.

2. **Sailor Moon's cosmic atmosphere** — Not the merchandise pinks, but the transformation sequences: cosmic, glowy, purple-blue-silver. The color grading of nighttime Tokyo through a magical lens. The feeling that the sky is alive and watching.

3. **Contemplative minimalism** — From zencephalon.com's DNA: content-first, visually restrained, philosophical. Eastern aesthetics serving thoughtful content.

The synthesis: *"What if a Sailor Moon art director designed a meditation app."*

## Logo

An enso circle with zodiac elements subtly integrated into the brushstroke. The word "ENSO" in widely-tracked, light-weight sans-serif beneath. The brushstroke should feel hand-drawn — imperfect, alive, not a perfect geometric circle.

## Tagline Candidates

- "Read the sky."
- "Your stars, drawn."
- "The circle completes."

## Color Palette

### Primary — "Moonlit Ink"

| Role | Hex | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Background | `#0d0d14` | Deep indigo-black, like a clear night sky |
| Surface | `#16162a` | Slightly lighter, for cards and panels |
| Text | `#e8e4df` | Warm off-white, like rice paper |
| Text muted | `#8a8aa0` | For secondary information |
| Border | `#2a2a4a` | Subtle separation lines |

### Accents — "Sailor Moon meets Sumi-e"

| Role | Hex | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Lavender | `#c4b8d4` | Primary accent — Sailor Moon's signature tint, moon silver |
| Gold | `#d4a574` | Highlights — warm gold like a crescent moon brooch |
| Rose | `#c47a8a` | Secondary — muted rose, SM energy filtered through Japanese restraint |
| Blue | `#7a9ec4` | Interactive elements — a quiet, contemplative blue |

### Key Insight

Sailor Moon's palette is sophisticated when you pull back the saturation. Think the transformation sequences — cosmic, glowy, purple-blue-silver — rather than the bright pinks of the merchandise. The gold accents come from the crescent moon motif, the signature brooch, the tiara. The lavender is the night sky filtered through magic.

### Chart Wheel Colors (Dark Theme)

| Element | Hex | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Circle lines | `#3a3a5c` | Muted indigo, visible but not dominant |
| Axis labels | `#c4b8d4` | Lavender accent for ASC/MC/DSC/IC |
| Cusp labels | `#8a8aa0` | Muted, secondary |
| Planet symbols | Per-planet colors | Existing planet colors work well on dark bg |

### Element Sign Colors (Muted for Dark Theme)

| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|

| Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) | Deep moss | `#4a5a3a` |
| Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) | Dusty sky | `#3a5a6a` |
| Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) | Deep ocean | `#3a4a5a` |

## Typography

### Headings — Cormorant Garamond

Elegant serif with slight calligraphic character. Evokes brushwork without being gimmicky. The contrast between thick and thin strokes echoes sumi-e ink variation.

Alternative: **Shippori Mincho** for authentic Japanese typographic roots.

### Body — Inter

Clean, modern, excellent readability. Pairs well with the ornamental heading font. Grounded and functional — the "boring" choice that lets the content breathe.

### Brand Mark — Custom

The word "ENSO" in widely-tracked (letter-spacing: 0.3em), light-weight (300) sans-serif. Uppercase. Quiet authority.

## Layout Philosophy

### Ma (間) as Design Element

Generous "darkspace" — the dark background is not empty, it's an active part of the composition. Like a sumi-e painting where the unpainted paper is as important as the brushstrokes.

- The chart wheel is the hero — floating in space, breathing room on all sides
- Controls tucked away minimally, appearing when needed
- Single-column, centered layout
- No borders, no boxes — use spacing and subtle opacity shifts to create hierarchy
- Let the cosmic background be felt

### Specific UI Elements

**The Chart Wheel**
- Thin, elegant lines (1-2px) instead of heavy strokes
- Subtle glow effects on planets (transformation sequence sparkles, but tasteful)
- Aspect lines with low opacity, brightening on hover
- Transparent background so the dark page shows through

**Inputs & Controls**
- Floating, minimal — almost part of the background
- Thin underline inputs (border-bottom only), no boxes — Japanese stationery feel
- Subtle transitions, no jarring state changes
- Ghost-style buttons with faint borders and soft hover glow

**Decorative Touches (Used Sparingly)**
- Faint star field or subtle particle texture in the background
- A thin crescent moon motif in the header
- On chart generation: an enso circle being "drawn" as a loading animation
- Constellation line patterns as very subtle background elements

## Anime Influence — Atmosphere, Not Cosplay

The Sailor Moon connection works best as **atmosphere** rather than direct reference:

- The cosmic color palette (deep blues, purples, silvers, golds)
- Sparkle/shimmer micro-animations on interactive elements
- Thin, elegant line work (magical girl transformation sequences are flowing lines)
- Typography with a slight editorial/manga-magazine quality
- A sense of **magic and wonder** in the transitions and reveals

**Avoid:** direct Sailor Moon imagery, chibi characters, anything that reads as fan-site.

## Mood References

- **Tsuki ga Kirei** (anime) — quiet, atmospheric night scenes
- **Muji** design language — Japanese minimalism in practice
- **Sailor Moon Crystal** — the reboot has a more sophisticated palette than the 90s original
- **Japanese incense packaging** (Nippon Kodo) — beautiful minimal design with subtle gold accents
- **Co-Star** app — modern astrology UI reference (then make it more refined)

## Voice & Tone

Quiet confidence. Not mystical-woo, not clinical-skeptic. The app presents the sky as it is — beautiful, mathematical, meaningful to those who look. Like a tea ceremony: precise, graceful, unhurried.
